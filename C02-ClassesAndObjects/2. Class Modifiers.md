A class declaration can be preceded by class *modifiers* that give the class certain properties:

- *annotations*

- *public* - A `public` class is publicly accessible: Anyone can declare references to objects of the class or access its public members. Without a modifier a class is only accessible within its own *package*.

- *abstract* - An `abstract` class is considered incomplete and no instances of the class may be created. Usually this is because the class contains `abstract` methods that must be implemented by a subclass.

- *final* - A `final` class cannot be subclassed.

- *strict floating point* - A class declared `strictfp` has all floating-point arithmetic in the class evaluated strictly.

### Notes
- A class cannot be both `final` and `abstract`
- Most Java development tools require that a `public` class be declared in a file with the same name as the class, which means there can only be one `public` class declared per file.
- Modifiers are allowed in any order, but it is recommended to use the order listed above.
