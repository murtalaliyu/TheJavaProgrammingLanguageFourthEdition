Field declarations can also be preceded by modifiers that control certain properties of the field:
- *annotations*
- *access modifiers*
- *static*
- *final*
- *transient* - This relates to object serialization
- *volatile* - This relates to synchronization and memory model issues

### Static Fields


### Notes
- A field cannot be both `final` and `volatile`.
- When multiple modifiers are applied to the same field declaration, it is recommended to use the order listed above.
- During initialization, the only requirement is that the initializer be of the right type and, if it invokes a method, no checked exceptions may be thrown because there is no surrounding code to catch the exception.
