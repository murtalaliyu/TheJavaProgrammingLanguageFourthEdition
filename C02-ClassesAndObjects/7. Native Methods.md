- If you need to write a program that will use some existing code that isn't written in Java, or if you need to manipulate some hardware directly, you can write *native methods*. 

- A native method lets you implement a method that can be invoked from Java but is written in a "native" language, usually C or C++.

- Native methods are declared using the `native` modifier. Because the method is implemented in another language, the method body is specified as a semicolon.

- E.g., here's a declaration of a native method that queries the OS for the CPU ID of the host machine:
		`public native int getCPUID();`

- Other than being implemented in native code, native methods are like all other methods: they can be overloaded, overridden, `final`, `static`, `synchronized`, `public`, `protected`, or `private`. A native method cannot, however, be declared `abstract` or `strctfp`.

- If you use a native method, all portability and safety of the code are lost. You cannot, for instance, use a native method in almost any code you expect to download and run from across a network connection (an applet, for example). The downloading system may or may not be of the same architecture, and even if it is, it might not trust your system well enough to run arbitrary native code.

- Native methods are implemented using an API provided by the people who wrote the VM on which the code executes. The standard one for C programs is called JNI - Java Native Interface.
