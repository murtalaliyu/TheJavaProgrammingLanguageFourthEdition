A class can have three kinds of members:
- *Fields* are the data variables associated with a class and its objects and hold the state of the class or object.
- *Methods* contain the executable code of a class and define the behavior of objects.
- *Nested classes* and *nested interfaces* are declarations of classes or interfaces that occur nested within the declaration of another class or interface.
