- The methods declared in an interface are implicitly `abstract` because no implementation is, or can be, given for them.

- No other method modifiers are permitted on an interface method declaration, except for annotations. They are implicitly `public`, so can have no other access modifier. 

- Of course, the implementation of these methods within a specific class can have any of these modifiers (`native`, `synchronized`, `strctfp`, `final`).

- Interface methods can never be `static` because `static` methods cant be `abstract`.
