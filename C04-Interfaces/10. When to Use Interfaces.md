- Both interfaces and abstract classes define a type with an abstract contract.

- Which to use and when? 

	- Interfaces provide a form of multiple inheritance, because you can implement multiple interfaces. A class can extend only one other class, even if that class has only abstract methods.

	- An abstract class can have a partial implementation, protected parts, static methods, and so on, whereas interfaces are limited to public constants and public methods with no implementation.

- These differences usually direct the choice of which tool is best to use in a particular implementation.

- If multiple inheritance is important or even useful, interfaces are used. However, an abstract class enables you to provide some or all of the implementation so that it can be inherited easily, rather than by explicit forwarding.
