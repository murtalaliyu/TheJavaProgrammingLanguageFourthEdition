- If an interface declares a constant of the same name as an inherited constant, regardless of their types, then the new constant hides the inherited one [see. p.86].

- The inherited constant can still be accessed with the qualified name of the constant, that is, the interface name followed by dot and then the constant name - the usual way of referring to static members.

- There are few reasons to hide existing fields, and all accesses to static fields, whether class or interface, should be via the name of the type in which that field is declared.

- If an interface inherits two or more constants with the same name, then any simple reference to the constant is ambiguous and results in a compile-time error.

- A class that implements more than one interface, or that extends a class and implements one or more interfaces, can experience the same hiding and ambiguity issues as an interface that extends more than one interface. The class's own static fields can hide the inherited fields of the interfaces it implements or the class it extends, and simple references to multiple-inherited non-hidden fields will be ambiguous.
