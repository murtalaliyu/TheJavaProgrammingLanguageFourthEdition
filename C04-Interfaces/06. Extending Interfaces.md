- Interfaces can be extended using the `extends` keyword. Interfaces, unlike classes, can extend more than one other interface.

- Because interfaces support multiple inheritance, the inheritance graph can contain multiple paths to the same super-interface. This means that constants and methods can be accessed in different ways. However, because interfaces define no implementation of methods, and provide no per-object fields, there are no issues regarding the semantics of this form of multiple inheritance.
