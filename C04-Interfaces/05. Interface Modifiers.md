An interface can be preceded by interface modifiers:

- *annotations*

- *public* - Without this modifier an interface is only accessible within its own package.

- *abstract* - All interfaces are implicitly `abstract`.

- *strict floating point* - An interface declared `strictfp` has all floating-point arithmetic, defined within the interface, evaluated strictly. This applies to initialization expressions for constants and to all nested types declared in the interface. In contrast to classes, this does not imply that each method in the interface is implicitly `strictfp` because that is an implementation detail. [see p.203, 9.1.3]
