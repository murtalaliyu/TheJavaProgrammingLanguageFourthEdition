An interface can declare three kinds of members:
- constants (fields)
- methods
- nested classes and interfaces


- All interface members are implicitly public, but, by convention, the `public` modifier is omitted.

- Having non-public members in an interface would make little sense; where it does make sense you can use the accessibility of the interface itself to control access to the interface members.
