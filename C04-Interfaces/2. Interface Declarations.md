An interface can declare three kinds of members:
- constants (fields)
- methods
- nested classes and interfaces


- All interface members are implicitly public, but, by convention, the `public` modifier is omitted.

- Having non-public members in an interface would make little sense; where it does make sense you can use the accessibility of the interface itself to control access to the interface members.


### Interface Constants

- An interface can declare named constants. These constants are defined as fields but are implicitly `public`, `static`, and `final` - again, by convention, the modifiers are omitted from the field declarations.

- These fields must also have initializers - *blank finals* are not permitted.

- Annotations can also be applied to the fields. [see chp15]

- Because interfaces contain no implementation details, they cannot define normal fields - such a definition would be dictating implementation policy to the classes that choose to implement the interface.

- Interfaces can define named constants because they are useful in the design of types. [see p.121]

- If you need shared, modifiable data in your interface you can achieve this by using a named constant that refers to an object that holds the data. A nested class is good for defining that object. [see chp5]
