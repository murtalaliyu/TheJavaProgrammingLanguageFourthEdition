Much of the power of interfaces comes from declaring and using only variables of interface type rather than of some specific class type. For example, you can define a general-purpose `sort` routine that can sort any array of `Comparable` objects without regard to what the class of those objects actually is - all the objects in the array should be the same type of course:

	class Sorter {
		static Comparable<?>[] sort(Comparable<?>[] list) {
			// implementation details ...
			return list;
		}
	}


References of interface type, however, can be used only to access members of that interface. For example, the following will produce a compile-time error:

	Comparable<Point> obj = new Point();
	double dist = obj.distance(p1);  // INVALID: Comparable has no distance method

If you want to treat `obj` as a `Point` object you must explicitly cast it to that type.
