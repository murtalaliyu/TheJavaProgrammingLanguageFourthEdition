- Nested interfaces are also always static and again, by convention the `static` modifier is omitted from the interface declaration.

- They serve simply as a structuring mechanism for related types. When we look at non-static nested classes you will see that they are inherently concerned with implementation issues.

- Since interfaces do not dictate implementation they cannot be non-static.
