- A nested class or interface that is declared as a `static` member of its enclosing class or interface acts just like any non-nested, or top-level, class or interface, except that its name and accessibility are defined by its *enclosing type*.

- The name of a nested type is expressed as *EnclosingName.NestedName*. The nested type is accessible only if the enclosing type is accessible.

- Static nested types serve as a structuring and scoping mechanism for logically related types.

- However, static nested types are members of their enclosing type and as such can access all other members of the enclosing type including private ones - through an appropriate object reference of course. This gives the nested type a special, privileged relationship with the enclosing type.

- Because static nested types are members of their enclosing type, the same accessibility rules apply to them as for other members.

- For classes this means that a static nested class or interface can have private, package, protected, or public access, while for interfaces, nested types are implicitly public.
