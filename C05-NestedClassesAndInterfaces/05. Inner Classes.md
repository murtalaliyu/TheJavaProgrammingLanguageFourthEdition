- Non-static nested classes are called *inner classes*.

- Non-static class members are associated with instances of a class - non-static fields are instance variables and non-static methods operate on an instance.

- An instance of an inner class is associated with an instance of its enclosing class - the *enclosing instance* or *enclosing object*.

- You often need to closely tie a nested class object to a particular object of the enclosing class. [see code/chp5/BankAccount]
