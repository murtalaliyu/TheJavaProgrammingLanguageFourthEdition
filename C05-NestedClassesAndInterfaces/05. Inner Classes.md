- Non-static nested classes are called *inner classes*.

- Non-static class members are associated with instances of a class - non-static fields are instance variables and non-static methods operate on an instance.

- An instance of an inner class is associated with an instance of its enclosing class - the *enclosing instance* or *enclosing object*.

- You often need to closely tie a nested class object to a particular object of the enclosing class. [see code/chp5/BankAccount]

- Inner classes cannot have static members (including static nested types), except for final static fields that are initialized to constants or expressions built up from constants. The rationale for allowing constants to be declared in an inner class is the same as that for allowing them in interfaces - it can be convenient to define constants within the type that uses them.

- As with top-level classes, inner classes can extend any other class - including its enclosing class (it is hard to think of a reason to do this) - implement any interface and be extended by any other class. An inner class can be declared `final` or `abstract`, and can have annotations applied to it.
