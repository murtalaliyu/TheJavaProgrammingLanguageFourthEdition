- Java is *strongly typed*, which means that it checks for type compatibility at compile time in most cases - preventing incompatible assignments by forbidding anything questionable.


### Compatibility

- When you are expecting a supertype and receive a subtype, a *widening conversion* takes place. Such a conversion causes the subtype object to be treated as an instance of the supertype and can be checked at compile time. No action is needed by the programmer in a widening conversion.

- Going the other way - taking a reference to a supertype and converting it to a reference to a subtype - is known as a *narrowing conversion*. Narrowing conversions must be explicitly requested using the *cast* operator. [p. 216]
