- Abstract classes are helpful when some of the behavior is defined for most or all objects of a given type, but other behavior makes sense only for particular classes and not for a general superclass. Such a class is declared `abstract`, and each method not implemented in the class is also marked `abstract`. (If you need to define some methods but you don't need to provide any implementation, you probably want to use interfaces).

- Most `abstract` classes fit a pattern in which a class's particular area of expertise requires someone else to provide a missing piece - this is commonly known as the "Template Method" pattern.

- In many cases the expertise methods are good candidates for being `final` so that the expertise cannot be compromised in any way.

- Any class can override methods from its superclass to declare them `abstract`, turning a concrete method into an `abstract` one at that point in the type tree. This technique is useful, for example, what a class's default implementation is invalid for a part of the class hierarchy.

- You cannot create an object of an `abstract` class because there would be no valid implementation for some methods that might well be invoked.
