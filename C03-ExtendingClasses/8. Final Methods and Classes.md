- Final classes and methods can improve security.

- You could use final, for example, on a `validatePassword` method to ensure that it does what it is advertised to do instead of being overridden to always return `true`. Or you can mark as `final` the class that contains the method so that it can never be extended to confuse the implementation of `validatePassword`.

- Marking a method or class `final` is a serious restriction on the use of the class. If you make a method `final`, you should really intend that its behavior be completely fixed.

- An alternative is to declare all methods in a class `final` but not the class itself. However, fields that the `final` methods rely on should be `final` or `private`, or else an extended class could change behavior by changing those fields.

- `final` simplifies optimizations. Some type checks become faster with `final` classes. In fact, many type checks become compile time checks, and errors can be caught earlier. If the compiler encounters a reference to a `final` class, it knows that the object referred to is exactly that type. The entire class hierarchy for that class is known, so the compiler can check whether any use is valid or invalid. With a non-`final` reference, some checks can happen only at run time.
