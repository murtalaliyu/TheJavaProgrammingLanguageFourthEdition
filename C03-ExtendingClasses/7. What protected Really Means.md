- Beyond being accessible within the class itself and to code within the same package (see chp. 18), a protected member can also be accessed from a class through object references that are of at least the same type as the class - that is, references of the class's type or one its subtypes.

- Protected `static` members can be accessed in any extended class. If `head` were a static field, any method (static or not) in `PriorityQueue` could access it. This is allowed because a subclass can't modify the contract of its static members because it can only hide them, not override them - hence, there is no danger of another class violating that contract.
