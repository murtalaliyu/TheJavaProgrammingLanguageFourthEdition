- Class extension provides two forms of inheritance:

	- inheritance of *contract* or *type*, whereby the subclass acquires the type of the superclass and so can be used polymorphically wherever the superclass could be used; and

	- inheritance of *implementation*, whereby the subclass acquires the implementation of the superclass in terms of its accessible fields and methods.

- Each class can present two different contracts - one for users of the class and one for extenders of the class. Both of these must be carefully designed.

- With class extension, inheritance of contract and inheritance of implementation always occur together. However, you can define new types independent of implementations by using *interfaces*. You can also reuse existing implementations, without affecting type, by manually using *composition* and *forwarding*.

- Class extension that involves generic classes has its own special rules concerning redefining members, overriding, and overloading.
